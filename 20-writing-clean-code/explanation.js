//JavaScript Coding Conventions
   /* In this challenge also we used the general JavaScript coding writing conventions and guides. 
    Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming which are developed by an individual, a team or a company.*/

//Coding conventions helps:

    //to write clean code
    //to improve code readability
    //to improve code re-useability and maintainability

//Coding conventions includes

    //Naming and declaration rules for variables
    //Naming and declaration rules for functions
    //Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments
    //Programming practices and principles

//Conventions use in 30DaysOfJavaScript
    //In this challenge we follow the regular JavaScript convention but I added also my preference of writing.

    //We used camelCase for variables and functions.
    //All variable names start with a letter.
    //We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
    //We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
    //Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
    //Arrow function instead of function declaration
    //Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
    //No trailing comma in the last value of an object
    //We prefer this +=, -=, *= /=, **= instead of the longer version
    //When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
